Hello,

Your mission is to find all the easter eggs and complete the objectives before the snow leopards steal all our baby
pandas. Work with urgency and look out for coins, they help pay the bills.

Good luck fellow panda.

Note: If you get stuck, refer to our elder panda scrolls for guidance:
- [Scroll 1](https://realpython.com/pandas-read-write-files/)
- [Scroll 2](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html)
- [Scroll 3](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_excl.html)

To get started:

1) go to the terminal and type: "pip install pandas openpyxl" and Enter
    Note: "pip3 install pandas openpyxl", if on mac OS
2) Execute/Run the PandaBook.py file and follow the instructions
3) Open up Flashlight.py and write some code to make your way around the forest by indexing through the forest variable
    Note: If you need to cheat, open the DarkBambooForest.xlsx for a full view of the forest
4) Once you have found the ``'$'`` sign (the exit) modify the maze variable and change the ``'$'`` to a ``'!'``
5) Write the forest dataframe to the
 file and open the file in Excel to check that it worked
6) Once complete, let Po know you want to see her for some cuddles
